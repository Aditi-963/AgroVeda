## 🏆 Submission for [INSERT HACKATHON NAME HERE]

**AgroVeda** was built with a single mission: **To save crops and save livelihoods.** We believe that technology should not be a luxury but a tool accessible to every farmer in India. This project is our attempt to bridge the gap between complex AI technology and the simple needs of our Annadatas (Farmers).

## 💡 The Problem
Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, but farmers lose **billions of dollars annually** due to undetected crop diseases.
* **Late Detection:** Farmers often notice diseases when it is already too late.
* **Lack of Knowledge:** Identifing specific fungal or bacterial infections requires expert knowledge that isn't always available.
* **Chemical Overuse:** Without knowing the exact disease, farmers often spray wrong or excessive chemicals, harming the soil and consumers.

## 🛠️ The Solution: AgroVeda
AgroVeda is an intelligent "Plant Doctor" in your pocket.
1.  **Instant Scanning:** Farmers can simply upload or click a photo of a crop leaf.
2.  **AI Diagnosis:** Our system analyzes the leaf texture and color patterns to detect diseases like *Early Blight*, *Yellow Leaf Curl*, and *Bacterial Spots*.
3.  **Immediate Results:** Within seconds, the user gets a "Healthy" or "Infected" status (Simulated for this MVP).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Neon Glassmorphism UI), JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python, Flask (for local API testing)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (The Vision)
We are not stopping here. To win this hackathon and go beyond, we plan to:
* ✅ **Real AI Integration:** Connect a trained TensorFlow/PyTorch model (CNN) for real-time accuracy.
* 📱 **Mobile App:** Launch a Flutter-based mobile app for offline usage in remote villages.
* 🗣️ **Regional Language Support:** Add Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu support so every farmer can use it.
* 🛒 **Medicine Recommendations:** Suggest specific bio-friendly cures based on the disease detected.
